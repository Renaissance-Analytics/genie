/**
 * THE MASTER WINDOW — Genie's actual main window, end to end (genie#228).
 *
 * Every other spec in this suite mounts a component on a harness page. This one
 * mounts the PRODUCT: `showE2EWindow` loads `${page}.html`, so pointing it at
 * `master` opens `renderer/pages/master.tsx` itself — the window a user looks at,
 * reading the same database through the same IPC. Until now nothing covered it at
 * all, which is a strange gap for the surface that hosts everything else.
 *
 * ONE THING IS STOOD IN FOR: the sign-in read. The page returns early to
 * `SignInPrompt` when the auth check says signed-out, and the E2E profile is a
 * throwaway with no session — so `main/e2e/mock.ts` answers `auth:whoami` with a
 * connected backend under this page and nothing else. The workspaces, the specs,
 * the layout restore, the panels and the ptys are all real (main/e2e/master.ts
 * only puts rows in the database).
 *
 * The last test is the one worth having. genie#229 was reported as terminal
 * output coming back mangled after a workspace switch: off-workspace panels stay
 * mounted-hidden so their ptys survive, a hidden element measures 0×0, and the
 * refit-on-resize pushed that nonsense geometry through to the pty — which a TUI
 * answers by REFLOWING its scrollback to a width the window never had. That is
 * invisible in a screenshot taken after the panel comes back; what gives it away
 * is the geometry the pty was told while it was off screen, which is what this
 * asserts.
